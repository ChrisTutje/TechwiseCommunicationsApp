## An Interplanetary Time Capsule
Welcome to Project Arecibo, space traveler! The Arecibo message was an interstellar radio broadcast carrying fundamental information about humanity and Earth. Many remember it as our first attempt to communicate with extraterrestrials.

With Project Arecibo, you can send out your own messages into the vast expanse of space - it can reach astronauts, aliens, or no one at all! Who knows who might read it out there?

Change your scenery. Chat with robots. Fight aliens. Learn about planets. Meet people from the past. Preserve your moment in time!
